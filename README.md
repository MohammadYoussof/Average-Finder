# Average finder

This is a simple programe written in the C programming language for increased effeciency. Sadly you have to change the number in the code to fit your needs. This will change in the near future.

### Instructions

1. Change the number to how many numbers there will be `const int Max_Amount_of_Numbers = 2;` 
2. Add the number you want to calculate seperated by a comma `int Average[Max_Amount_of_Numbers] = {55, 32};`
3. `cd` into the directory where you stored the programe
4. `gcc Find-Average.c` 
5. Finally `./a.out`
